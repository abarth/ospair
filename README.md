# Notes
 - Single player is a confusing name. Consider 1v1.
 - Might be useful to be able to force a player to have a bye.
   Joel was running late and we might have wanted to give him
   a bye in the first round.
 - Need to check people off as they check in.
 - Need to be able to go back to registration
 - Need a round timer
  - Possibly in a separate tab for projector
  - Possibly on the pairings page
 - Would be nice to see the pairings by table
 - Convert the delete button to a trash can icon
 - Should be able to see the standings before all the matches finish
 - Need a "final standings" page or a "finish tournament" button
 - Could also support cutting to a top-N single elimination bracket
